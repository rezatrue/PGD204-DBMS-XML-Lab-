Lesson 1: create table in oracle

	SQL>create TABLE depositor 
		(customer_name varchar2(20), 
		 account_number varchar2(20),
		 CONSTRAINT depositor_name_number_pk PRIMARY KEY (customer_name,   account_number),
		 CONSTRAINT depositor_customer_name_fk FOREIGN KEY (customer_name) 
                                                       REFERENCES customer(customer_name),
		 CONSTRAINT depositor_account_number_fk FOREIGN KEY (account_number) 
                                                       REFERENCES account(account_number)
	);



Lesson 2: Insert
			
		SQL>insert into account	values ('A-9732', 'Perryridge', 1200);
	OR	
		SQL>insert into account (branch_name, balance, account_number)
			values ('Perryridge',  1200, 'A-9732');
		
Lesson 3: Update

	Increase all accounts with balances over $10,000 by 6%, all other accounts receive 5%.
	
		SQL>update account set balance = balance * 1.06 where balance > 10000; 
			update account set balance = balance * 1.05	where balance =< 10000;
		
Lesson 4: Delete
			
		SQL>delete from account	where branch_name = 'Perryridge';
